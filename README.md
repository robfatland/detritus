OMC/PB was developed for kids ages 10 - 13 or so interested in math and coding; but who are not inclined 
towards competitions. Topics stray from the beaten path of the middle school math curriculum. Everything
is bundled in IPython notebooks (file extension `.ipynb`) for the sake of combining narrative with
code.

An illustrative topic is under "Meru Prastarah" which is a mythical mountain at the center of the
universe... I believe this is referred to in 7th century AD Indian manuscripts. This mountain is
represented visually with steps to the top in a structure of poetic meter numbered in a manner 
that western students learn as "Pascal's Triangle". This construct is related to addition even-odd parity, 
logical exclusive or, the Serpienski gasket, the Fibonacci series, logarithmic spirals, phyllotaxis in plants,
the golden ratio, continued fractions, cellular automata, chaos (particularly
the chaos game), probability, protein synthesis in predatory gastropods, Python coding, Turtle graphics, animation,
language synthesis, and of course fractal geometry.


A big part of the curriculum is the presence of the unreliable narrator. Starting with knights and knaves
and the prisoner/hat problem we can begin to discuss implicit information and our ability to analyze the
premise of a given problem. This continues with an exploration of the wolf-duck pursuit problem and in 
particular the students' interest in changing the parameters of this problem.
